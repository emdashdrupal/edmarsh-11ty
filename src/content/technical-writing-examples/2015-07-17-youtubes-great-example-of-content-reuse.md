I found a brilliant and surprising example of content reuse when I wanted to upload the [latest Content Content podcast](http://edmarsh.com/2015/07/08/content-content-podcast-episode-4-curse-of-knowledge-with-tom-johnson/) to YouTube. I'd never uploaded a podcast to YouTube before, so I tried to upload the .mp3 file directly. YouTube quickly told me that wasn't allowed.

I clicked the link, and they have a [nicely written topic](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1696878?hl=en) about how to create a video using familiar tools to add images to your audio and then save as an accepted format.

So then I looked around their help system to see what export settings YouTube recommended. On the [relevant help topic](https://support.google.com/youtube/troubleshooter/2888402?hl=en&ref_topic=2888648), they asked a question about which format you wanted to convert.

When I selected the mp3 format answer, the same topic appeared that I found before, _embedded in the page_.

The smart folks at YouTube decided to _reuse the content_, aiding the user and saving them at least one click, and certainly reducing search time. It's a great example of thinking through what people are looking for and how to react to that.

Have you seen other good examples of reuse on the Web? Let us know in the comments.
