<p>&quot;The best term to use to call what I was doing was UX writing&quot; says UX Writer MJ Babic on this episode of the Content Content podcast. MJ's had a diverse career, from marketing, feature articles, science journals, and some tech writing. But her plan is &quot;helping people complete their tasks with digital products&quot;, and to &quot;bring good writing to whatever corner I'm working in at the moment&quot;.</p>
