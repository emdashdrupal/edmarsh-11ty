We return from a hiatus with content strategist Rahel Bailie! She joins Ed Marsh to talk about an uneven history of content strategy, object-oriented content, how her career has led her across two continents, and the history of women in technical communication.


Her [_Content Strategy_ book](https://smile.amazon.com/Content-Strategy-Connecting-Business-Benefits/dp/1937434168/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=rahel+bailie&qid=1618343360&sr=8-1) with [Noz Urbina](https://edmarsh.com/2020/04/07/1000-or-100000-meetings-with-noz-urbina-content-content-podcast/) remains one of Ed's most highlighted (highlit?) reads. We discuss Content Operations (ContentOps or DocOps), introducing efficiency, and more. I hope you laugh as much as we did.
