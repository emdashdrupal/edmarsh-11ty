<p>Ed Marsh has always been curious about technology. As a kid, he was the one who pushed buttons to see what happened. This led to some scolding and an award-winning career as a technical writer.</p>
<p>He generally dislikes writing in the third person.</p>

Since then, he has self-hosted and modified a WordPress version on this site. He also converted this site to a static site generated by Hugo in late 2024.</p>
<p>Ed started his career as a tech writer in New York City for small- and mid-size software companies. In 2011 he joined Goldman Sachs as a technical writer and eLearning developer in Jersey City, NJ and New York City, rising to the position of Vice President. Working in this environment taught Ed the importance of working across silos, managing risk, and governance.</p>
<p>He is experienced in, and passionate about, information architecture and content strategy. As a technical writer, he has created online help, multimedia, podcasts, eLearning modules, cheat sheets, technical illustrations, printed manuals, and PDF documentation.</p>
