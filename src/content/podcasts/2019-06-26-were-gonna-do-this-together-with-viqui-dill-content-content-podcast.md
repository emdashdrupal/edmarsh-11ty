Viqui Dill, Senior Technical Writer at American Woodmark in Virginia, talks to Ed Marsh how everyone is a project manager in some form, life in the (literal) hardware industry, her day of 500 hugs, what is just-in-time documentation, and more.

Viqui is also an accomplished "bad-ass bass player' and a self-proclaimed techcomm evangelist.
