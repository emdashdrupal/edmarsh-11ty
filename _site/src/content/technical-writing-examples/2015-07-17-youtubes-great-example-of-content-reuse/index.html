<p>I found a brilliant and surprising example of content reuse when I wanted to upload the <a href="http://edmarsh.com/2015/07/08/content-content-podcast-episode-4-curse-of-knowledge-with-tom-johnson/">latest Content Content podcast</a> to YouTube. I'd never uploaded a podcast to YouTube before, so I tried to upload the .mp3 file directly. YouTube quickly told me that wasn't allowed.</p>

<p>I clicked the link, and they have a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1696878?hl=en">nicely written topic</a> about how to create a video using familiar tools to add images to your audio and then save as an accepted format.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/youtube_convert_audio_help_page.png" alt="YouTube topic page for converting an audio-only file to a format that YouTube accepts."> YouTube topic page for converting an audio-only file to a format that YouTube accepts.</p>
<p>So then I looked around their help system to see what export settings YouTube recommended. On the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/troubleshooter/2888402?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2888648">relevant help topic</a>, they asked a question about which format you wanted to convert.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/youtube_supported_file_formats_before_expansion.png" alt="YouTube's supported file format page asks users what format they're trying to convert if one of the accepted formats aren't what they're starting with"> YouTube's supported file format page asks users what format they're trying to convert if one of the accepted formats aren't what they're starting with</p>
<p>When I selected the mp3 format answer, the same topic appeared that I found before, <em>embedded in the page</em>.</p>

<p>The smart folks at YouTube decided to <em>reuse the content</em>, aiding the user and saving them at least one click, and certainly reducing search time. It's a great example of thinking through what people are looking for and how to react to that.</p>
<p>Have you seen other good examples of reuse on the Web? Let us know in the comments.</p>
